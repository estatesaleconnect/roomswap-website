            <h2 class="section-title">Estate Sale Services</h2>
            <p>Settling an estate is one of the most overwhelming tasks a family can face. Whether you've lost a loved one, are downsizing, or managing a property transition, you shouldn't have to navigate it alone. Room Swap offers <strong>free in-home estate consultations</strong> to help you understand your options and make informed decisions about the contents of a home.</p>

                        <h3>Free In-Home Consultations</h3>
                        <p>We come to you at no cost and no obligation. We'll walk through the home, assess the contents, and provide an honest evaluation of what you're working with — from furniture and antiques to jewelry, collectibles, and everyday household items.</p>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h3>Expert Valuations</h3>
                        <p>With a decade of experience and millions of dollars in estate items evaluated and sold, we know how to identify value others might miss. Our research-driven approach ensures you get accurate, fair assessments grounded in current market data — not guesswork.</p>

                        <p>We've built strong relationships with reputable auction houses and estate sale companies across the South Carolina Lowcountry. When a particular approach serves you better than what we offer directly, we'll connect you with professionals we personally trust.</p>

            <p>Every estate is different. After our consultation, we'll recommend the best path forward based on the contents, timeline, and your family's needs. Here are the three main approaches we help coordinate:</p>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Direct Buyout</h3>
                    <p>The fastest option. We make a fair cash offer on part or all of an estate's contents and handle removal on our schedule. Ideal when you need to settle quickly or clear a property for sale. No waiting, no commissions — just a straightforward transaction.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Auction</h3>
                    <p>For estates with higher-value items, antiques, or specialty collections, auction can maximize returns. We'll connect you with trusted auction partners in the area who specialize in estate items, and we'll help you understand the process and what to expect.</p>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Estate Sale</h3>
                    <p>A full on-site estate sale can be the best approach for homes with a wide variety of items across all price ranges. We work with experienced estate sale companies who handle pricing, marketing, staffing, and execution — so you don't have to.</p>

            <p>Consignment at Room Swap is straightforward and hassle-free. You bring in your quality furniture or treasures, we evaluate it, and if it's a good fit for our showroom, we'll display and sell it for you. When it sells, you get paid. No yard sales, no online listings, no dealing with buyers. We handle everything.</p>
