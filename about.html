            <h1 class="section-title">How Consignment Works</h1>
            <p>Consignment at Room Swap is straightforward and hassle-free. You bring in your quality furniture, we evaluate it, and if it's a good fit for our showroom, we'll display and sell it for you. When it sells, you get paid. No yard sales, no online listings, no dealing with buyers. We handle everything.</p>

                    <h3>1. Bring It In</h3>
                    <p>Stop by during business hours with photos of your items, or bring smaller pieces directly to our showroom. For larger furniture or estate contents, contact us to discuss pickup options.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>2. We Evaluate</h3>
                    <p>We'll assess your items for quality, condition, and market demand. We're looking for pieces that are clean, functional, and in good condition. Not everything makes the cut, but we'll give you honest feedback.</p>
